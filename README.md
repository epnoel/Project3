C++ programming language
fstream library for reading in data from a csv file
sstream library for manipulating strings

Algorithms Implemented
Quicksort: Used to sort each row of the 2D vector data structure
Binary Search: Used to search through each row of the 2D vector in the quickest time possible

Data Structures Used
2D vector: Stores website names and their maliciousness ratings
Map: Maps website names to their maliciousness ratings
Unordered map: Stores website names and their maliciousness ratings in an unordered manner
